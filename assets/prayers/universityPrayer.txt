Godfrey Okoye University Prayer

God Our Father, all knowledge,
- wisdom and truth come from you.
You are the Creator of the entire universe with all its beauty and richness.
Out of your infinite love you created human beings and endowed them with unfathomable ability to explore, discover, care for the earth, glorify your name and expand your kingdom of justice, love and peace. We your beloved children praise and thank you!
In your wisdom you established GO
University to shine in the world as God's own university. It is a precious gift from you to the Church in Enugu Diocese, existing to serve humanity and the universal Church. We your beloved children praise and thank you!
Lord Jesus Christ, you called us members of the GO University Family to share and promote your mission of salvation of the world; to be a reincarnation of intellectual vitality; to champion love and friendship;
to excel in intercultural thinking and remain sound in moral and religious dialogue. We your beloved children praise and thank you!
Lord, lead us to remain ever committed to the unity of knowledge and always ask:
Where is the evidence? You established GO University to be an institution with footprints of a great achiever, the heartbeat of excellence and lavishly endowed in Science and Arts. We your beloved children praise and thank you!
Holy Spirit, guide and direct the management and members of staff to be steadfast in the pursuit of the set goals and values of the university. Enable them, by your powerful protection, to discharge their duties with honesty, dedication and love. Instill in the students the zeal to excel in the quest for knowledge animated by truth. Holy Spirit, strengthen and establish in our university a culture of sound teaching, research, peace, service, and love. We make our prayer through Christ Our Lord. Amen!
Our Lady Seat of Wisdom, pray for us!
