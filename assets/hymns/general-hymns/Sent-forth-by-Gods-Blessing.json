      "Sent forth by God's blessing, Our true faith confessing,\nThe people of God from this dwelling take leave.\nGod's sacrifice ended, 0 now be extended\nThe fruits of this Mass in all hearts who believe.\nThe seed of Christ's teaching, Our inner souls reaching,\nShall blossom in action for God and for all.\nGod's grace shall incite us, In love shall unite us\nTo further God's kingdom and answer the call.",
      "With praise and thanksgiving To God who is living,\nThe tasks of our everyday life we embrace.\nOur faith ever sharing, In love ever caring,\nWe claim as our family all those of each race.\nOne bread that has fed us, One light that has led us\nUnite us as one in the life that we share.\nThen may all the living With praise and thanksgiving\nGive honor to Christ and his name that we bear."
